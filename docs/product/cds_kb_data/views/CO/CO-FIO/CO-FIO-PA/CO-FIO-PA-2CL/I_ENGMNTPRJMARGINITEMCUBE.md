What is the distribution of project margins across different profit centers and sales organizations? How do various accounting documents and ledger items relate to project margins? What are the quantities and amounts in different currencies and units of measure for project margin items? How do customer and supplier details influence project margins? What is the impact of different cost centers and functional areas on project margins? To help you decide which CDS view to use for your purposes, SAP has introduced the annotation ObjectModel.supportedCapabilities that indicates the most appropriate use cases for each CDS view.
