description: This CDS view can be used as analytical provider (primary data source) for an analytical query. It provides access to the consolidated data for both statutory and management consolidation reporting. You can create group reports for consolidation groups, such as consolidated balance sheets and consolidated P&amp;L statements based on organizational units such as profit centers, segments, and companies, with the data provided by this CDS view. The CDS view provides the data to answer the following business questions: What is the consolidation dimension, consolidation chart of accounts, and consolidation ledger in which the reporting logic is applied? What is the organizational unit information of the consolidated data in my specified fiscal year and period? What is the document number, posting level, and document type for a certain journal entry? What are the amounts of relevant financial statement items in the transaction currency, local currency, and group currency? What are the interunit elimination-related amounts, for example, for eliminations between profit centers, segments, and companies? To help you decide which CDS view to use for your purposes, SAP has introduced the annotation ObjectModel.supportedCapabilities that indicates the most appropriate use cases for each CDS view.
